[VolSync](https://github.com/backube/volsync) is a Kubernetes operator for **asynchronous data replication and backup** of persistent volumes. It enables efficient synchronization between storage locations using **rsync, restic, or Rclone**, making it ideal for **backups, disaster recovery, and data migration** across clusters.  

### **How It Works**
VolSync automates **snapshot-based or file-based** replication of PVCs, supporting:
- **Local backups** (e.g., to another PVC or storage backend)
- **Remote replication** (e.g., across Kubernetes clusters)
- **Incremental synchronization** to optimize storage and bandwidth usage
