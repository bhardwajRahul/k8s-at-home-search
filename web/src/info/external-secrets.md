[External Secrets](https://external-secrets.io/) is a Kubernetes operator that synchronizes secrets from **external secret management systems** (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Google Secret Manager, 1Password) into Kubernetes secrets. It ensures that sensitive data stays outside the cluster while being securely referenced within applications. **External Secrets** supports **automatic synchronization, templating, and multi-backend integration**, making it a scalable and secure solution for managing secrets in Kubernetes environments.
