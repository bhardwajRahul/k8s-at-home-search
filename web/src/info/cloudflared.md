[Cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) is a lightweight proxy client for securely connecting applications to Cloudflare’s network. It powers **Cloudflare Tunnel**, allowing services to be exposed without opening ports or configuring firewall rules. `cloudflared` routes traffic through Cloudflare’s global network, enhancing security with DDoS protection, authentication, and encrypted connections. It supports **HTTP, TCP, and QUIC**, making it ideal for self-hosted services, remote access, and **zero-trust networking**.
