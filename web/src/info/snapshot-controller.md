[Snapshot Controller](https://github.com/piraeusdatastore/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/snapshot-controller) deploys the **Kubernetes snapshot-controller**, a required component for **CSI volume snapshotting**. It manages the lifecycle of **VolumeSnapshots**, enabling the creation, listing, and deletion of snapshots. The controller is **CSI-agnostic**, meaning it works with any **CSI driver** that supports the snapshot API, providing a standardized way to handle persistent volume snapshots in Kubernetes clusters.
